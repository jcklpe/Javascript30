# 30 Javascript Projects Challenge



I'm doing the [[Wes Bos Javascript 30 class]](https://javascript30.com/). Supposed to be 30 projects in 30 days but I'm probably going to do something like 3 a day. Want to bone up on my vanilla Javascript skills. Learning a lot! I'm trying to personalize the projects as much as possible and make them my own from the get go. I might spin off some of them into bigger projects too.
